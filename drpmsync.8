.SH NAME
drpmsync \- sync a file tree with deltarpms

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B drpmsync
.RB [ -c
.IR config ]
.RI [ source ]
.I dir
.br
.B drpmsync
.RB [ -s | -S ]
.I serverconfig
.br
.B cgi-bin/drpmsync

.SH DESCRIPTION
Drpmsync keeps a local file system tree in sync with a remote one.
Its intended use is to work with rpm trees; the deltarpm technology
can only save bandwidth if rpms get transmitted. Please use the
rsync program for normal file trees.

Drpmsync can run in two modes: as a client it connects to a server,
receives a file list and brings the tree up to date, as a server
it answers incoming requests and transmits files and rpms.

.SH CLIENT MODE
In this mode drpmsync updates the tree in
.IR dir .
It opens the configuration file
.IB dir /drpmsync/config
to get information about which server to use and other settings.
You can specify a different configuration file with the
.B -c
option.
The following settings are understood (the default for the boolean
settings is false):
.sp
.ne 3
.B source:
.I server1
.IR server2 ...
.PP
This is a list of servers to connect to. Drpmsync advances through
this list until a working server is found. If a source is specified
on the command line it is used instead of the one from the
configuration. The syntax for the server entries is
"\fIhost\fP[\fB:\fP\fIport\fP]/\fItree\fP".
.sp
.ne 3
.B log:
.I logfile
.PP
Specifies the name of a logfile. If the name does not start with
a slash,
.IB dir /drpmsync/
is prepended to it.
.sp
.ne 3
.B generate_deltas:
.BR true|false
.PP
Controls whether drpmsync generates a delta if it receives a new
version of a rpm and the server doesn't provide a delta. This
is only useful if the local tree is also exported to other clients
via a local drpmsync server.
.sp
.ne 3
.B generate_delta_compression:
.I comp
.PP
This parameter is forwarded to the makedeltarpm program when
creating deltas. An example would be
.BR gzip,gzip .
.sp
.ne 3
.B keep_deltas:
.BR true|false
.PP
Tell drpmsync to save received or freshly created deltas to the
.IB dir /drpmsync/delta
directory. Automatically true if
.B generate_deltas
or
.B keep_uncombined
is set to true.
.sp
.ne 3
.B keep_uncombined:
.BR true|false
.PP
This tells drpmsync to request uncombined deltas from the server instead
of a precombined single delta. This makes sense if you re-export the
tree and want to maximize the number of versions your clients can
update from.
.sp
.ne 3
.B always_get_rpm:
.BR true|false
.PP
Configures whether drpmsync should request that the full rpm is
always sent along with the delta. Only makes sense if you have a
fast network connection so that applydeltarpm takes longer than
transmitting the ful rpm.
.sp
.ne 3
.B deltarpmpath:
.I path
.PP
Sets the directory where drpmsync searches for the deltarpm programs.
The default is to search the
.B $PATH
variable.

.SH SERVER MODE
Drpmsync can wither work as CGI script or as a standalone server.
CGI script mode is automatically selected if the
.B REQUEST_METHOD
environment variable is set. In this mode drpmsync expects the
.B DRPMSYNC_CONFIG
environment variable to contain the path to a server config file.
For apache you can set this with the
.B SetEnv
directive.

Standalone mode is selected with the
.B -s
or
.B -S
option. In this mode the server configuration must be specified as
an argument to the drpmsync program. The
.B -s
option makes the drpmsync program background itself and exit right
away, while
.B -S
keeps the server in the foreground.

The server configuration can contain the following settings:
.sp
.ne 3
.B allow:
.I pattern1
.IR pattern2 ...
.br
.B deny:
.I pattern1
.IR pattern2 ...
.PP
This provides the access control for the server.
.I pattern
can either be a simple glob pattern (only
.B *
is supported) or it can be a full regular expression if it is written
as
.BR /RE/ .
The regular expression is automatically anchored at the start and the
end. Examples are
.B 10.10.*
or
.BR /10\e.10\e..*/
If either the numerical ip address or the domain name of the client
matches any entry of the deny list, access is forbidden. Otherwise
the allow list is searched for a match. If none is found, access
is also denied. The default setting for both lists is empty, so
you have to provide an allow list to allow access for the clients.
.sp
.ne 3
.B log:
.I logfile
.PP
Specifies the path of a logfile.
.sp
.ne 3
.B no_combine:
.BR true|false
.PP
If this setting is true the server does not combine deltarpms.
This increases to amount of data that has to be transfered but
reduces the processor load on the server.
.sp
.ne 3
.B tree:
.I external_path
.I internal_path
.PP
This statements exports the tree located at
.I internal_path
to the clients as directory
.IR external_path .
All of the above settings are saved as settings of this particular
tree, so different trees can use different configurations. This
also means that the configuration directives of a tree must be
above the
.B tree
statement.
.sp
.sp
.ne 3
The following settings are global and only needed for standalone mode:
.sp
.ne 3
.B serverlog:
.I logfile
.PP
Specifies the path of a logfile used for logging server events.
.sp
.ne 3
.B servername:
.IR hostname [: port ]
.PP
The name of the server. If
.I hostname 
is empty, the fully qualified domain name is used instead. The port
defaults to port 80.
.sp
.ne 3
.B serveraddr:
.I addr
.PP
This address is used for binding the server's socket. If not specified,
connections can come from any interface.
.sp
.ne 3
.BI serveruser:
.I user
.br
.BI servergroup:
.I group
.PP
Configures the user and group the servers swicthes to after binding
the socket to the desired port. Examples are
.B nobody
or
.BR wwwrun .
.sp
.ne 3
.BI maxclients:
.I num
.PP
This settings limits the maximum number of concurrent connections to
.IR num .
The default value is 10 connections.
.sp
.ne 3
.B deltarpmpath:
.I path
.PP
Sets the directory where drpmsync searches for the deltarpm programs.
The default is to search the
.B $PATH
variable.

.SH FILES
