.TH FRAGISO 8 "Mar 2007"
.SH NAME
fragiso \- split rpm packages from an iso and reassemble the iso later on

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fragiso
.B make
.I iso
.I fiso
.br
.B fragiso
.B list
.I fiso
.br
.B fragiso
.B fill
.RB [ -m ]
.I fiso iso

.SH DESCRIPTION
fragiso can be used to convert an iso file into a fragment file, which
is a list describing all of the rpms on the iso and a data chunk
containing everything but the rpms. It is used by
.B drpmsync
when an iso needs to be transfered. The idea is that often the rpms
on the iso are already available on the destination host, so it saves
bandwith to first transfer the fragmented iso, copy the locally
available rpms, transfer the unavailable rpms and reassemble the
iso file.

.B fragiso
.B make
converts the iso into the fragment iso,
.B fragiso
.B list
can be used to extract the rpm information. This information consists
of the offset and length of all rpms and the lead/signature header
md5sum plus the header/payload md5sum. To reassemble the iso one
has to copy the rpms at the right offset into a new file and then
use
.B fragiso
.B fill
later on to provide all data not contained in the rpms. The
.B -m
option tells fragiso to print the resulting md5sum of the iso to stdout.
It can be used for verification purposes.
