Description: This package contains tools to create and apply deltarpms. A deltarpm contains the difference between an old and a new version of an RPM, which makes it possible to recreate the new RPM from the deltarpm and the old one. You do not need to have a copy of the old RPM, because deltarpms can also work with installed RPMs.
