.SH NAME
combindeltarpm \- combine multiple deltarpms to a single one

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B combinedeltarpm
.RB [ -v ]
.RB [ -V
.IR version ]
.RB [ -z
.IR compression ]
.RB [ -S
.IR signaturerpm ]
.I olddeltarpms...
.I newdeltarpm

.SH DESCRIPTION
combinedeltarpm creates a new deltarpm from multiple old ones.
Applying the rsulting deltarpm has the same effect as applying
each of the old ones in the specifed order. Use the
.B -v
option to make combinedeltarpm more verbose about its work.
.PP
combinedeltarpm normally produces a V3 format deltarpm, use the
.B -V
option to specify a different version if desired. The
.B -z
option can be used to specify a different compression method, the
default is to use the same compression method as used in the
last of the old deltarpms.
.PP
If you want to use a different header
signature you can also specify a rpm with the
.B -S
option which will be used as signature reference. This feature can
be used to if a deltarpm was made against an unsigned rpm which
later got signed.

.SH MEMORY CONSIDERATIONS
The implementation of combinedeltarpm currently unpacks the
add-blocks of the deltarpms in memory, thus it needs about twice
the uncompressed payload size of the target rpm.
